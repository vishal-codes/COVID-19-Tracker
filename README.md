# COVID-19-Data
## Description

This is a project which I made while learning React.js from a [YouTube tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3pIMJUZxM) Using this web application one can obtain all time data of the effects of COVID-19 globally as well as on
specific nations. It is built using React.js, Material UI, disease.sh API and is deployed on Firebase.
The web app features a section for displaying rise in cases, recoveries and deaths on that specific day. It
also features an interactive and responsive world map that visualizes the total cases of every nation with respect to area of circle displayed on the map and a Twitter feed
of WHO(World Health Organization) while keeping the website mobile friendly.
